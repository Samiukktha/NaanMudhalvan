# Phase 1: Project Definition and Design Thinking

## Project Overview:

The project aims to analyze and visualize air quality data from monitoring stations in Tamil Nadu. The primary objectives are as follows:

 Analyze Air Quality Trends: Explore air quality data to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and changes over time.

 Identify Pollution Hotspots: Determine areas within Tamil Nadu that consistently experience high levels of air pollution, enabling targeted interventions.

Predict RSPM/PM10 Levels: Develop a predictive model using SO2 and NO2 levels to estimate RSPM/PM10 levels, aiding in early pollution detection and management.

Tools and Technologies:

 Python

 Visualization Libraries

 Machine Learning Libraries

Design Thinking:

Design thinking is an essential process in problem-solving, emphasizing a user-centric approach. In this phase, we'll outline our approach to understanding and solving the problem.

1.Understanding the Problem:

Define Objectives: We have identified three main objectives for our project, which are to analyze air quality trends, identify pollution hotspots, and build a predictive model for RSPM/PM10 levels.

Gather Data: Acquire air quality data from dataset link provided. The dataset includes parameters like SO2, NO2, RSPM/PM10 levels, location information, and date.

Model Development: Develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms, with SO2 and NO2 levels as input features and RSPM/PM10 levels as the target variable.

    Action Plan:

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Use a simple linear regression model to predict RSPM/PM10 levels based on SO2 and NO2 levels.

Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error or R-squared.

2.Ideation and Design:

Analysis Approach:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data, remove duplicates and handle missing values and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to gain initial insights into the data, identify trends, and visualize air quality patterns.

Time Series Analysis: For trend identification, use time series analysis techniques such as decomposition and autocorrelation.

Spatial Analysis: Utilize geographical information to map pollution hotspots within Tamil Nadu.

Model Development: Develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms, with SO2 and NO2 levels as input features and RSPM/PM10 levels as the target variable.

Visualization Selection:

Create a basic dashboard or a set of simple visualizations using Excel, Google Sheets, or a free data visualization tool.

 Line Charts: Use line charts to visualize temporal trends in air quality data, showing how pollution levels change over time.

 Heat-maps: Employ heatmaps to display spatial variations in air quality, helping to pinpoint pollution hotspots.

 Regression Plots: Visualize the relationship between SO2, NO2, and SPM/PM10 levels using regression plots.

3. Prototyping:

Develop code snippets and prototypes for data preprocessing, EDA, and visualization.

Experiment with different machine learning algorithms for the predictive model and evaluate their performance.

4. Testing and Feedback:

Gather feedback to refine the project design and approach.

5.  Implementation Plan:

Develop a detailed project plan outlining tasks, milestones, and timelines.

Allocate resources and responsibilities among team members.
